Do you ever find yourself starting blankly at your Steam library scrolling up and down wondering why you keep
purchasing those Humble Bundles that force an endless stream of games (most you've never heard of) into your life?

Do you sometimes question what it is you are doing with your life?

Do you need a tissue?

If you've answered yes to any of the above questions - this app is for you!

We created this app to add a little spice to our gaming lives by randomly selecting a game from our Steam
libraries for us to play in the event that we are so bored that we result to playing a random game (one we have
or have not played before - your choice). Check it out!

Uses Python 3, and the dependencies can be acquired via our requirements.txt file:
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Happy gaming!
